The file called wave_2D_dn_vc.py has a solver for wave eq. with Neumann boundary conditions and variable coefficient.
Could be misleading name as it says "dn". Was planning to make it solve Dirichlet b.c aswell, but unfortunatly it does not.

There is also tests in the program, that has names so that it should be easy to understand what they are supposed to test.

The Pdf file has some explenations and the general scheme, with both special case of step1 and how the boundary conditions 
is handled.

Further there is some pictures from some of the tests that have been vizualised.
